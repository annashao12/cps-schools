## Overall Types

**Chicago Public Schools are divided into three overall types:**

-   For residents in an attendance boundary
-   Open to any student residing in Chicago
-   Choice programs in which admissions criteria varies by school
    -   Some are based on test scores and 7th grade performance
    -   Some use a computerized lottery system to determine which students are admitted to the school

## Comparison between Types

**Most students attend neighborhood, charter, and selective enrollment schools.** Other school types are not as common in number nor attended by as many CPS students.

## Specific Types

Some schools can be classified into several of the following categories. *The analysis was based on the primary category within the School Progress report provided by CPS.*

-   **Neighborhood**: Within a neighborhood attendance boundary. May still accept students from outside the boundary.

-   **Citywide-Option**: No neighborhood attendance boundary. Lottery based.

-   **Selective enrollment**: Provide academically advanced students with challenging college preparatory experience. Students must take an admissions test.

-   **Magnet**: Offer specialized programs, attracting students from across the city.

-   **Military academy:** Operate in a structured environment. Students wear uniforms and take part in leadership and co-curricular activities. Lottery based.

-   **Small**: Has smaller student populations.

-   **Charter**: Independently operated schools. Can exercise autonomy over many student-related policies.

-   **Contract**: Managed by external operators. Usually have contracts to operate for five-year terms.
