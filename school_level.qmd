Individual schools split by school type were investigated.

## Student Body Size

```{r fig.align = "center"}
#| label: boxplot

knitr::include_graphics("graphs/pop_each_final_2.png")
```

The median student population size was less than 1,000 students for all school types except for selective enrollment schools. School types with a smaller number of schools tend to have similar population sizes. Meanwhile, neighborhood and magnet school sizes varied more widely.

Each section labeled with a number indicates one of Chicagoâ€™s 77 community areas. Most community areas offer at least one public high school, but school locations are not necessarily evenly distributed, potentially reflecting community needs and population density.
